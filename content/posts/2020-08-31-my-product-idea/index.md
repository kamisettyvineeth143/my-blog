## App Description (Problem Statement and Solution) :

The main problem that the art community now a days face is exposure. Being an artist myself, I know how hard it is to
gather enough audience to showcase your artworks and even if you manage to do so, there is no way you will get 100%
honest insights. Almost all of the world's population is now on the internet and yet, it is hard to find a perfect audience that
has a keen eye for art. Instagram, for example, gives enough platform to artists to showcase their work but due to lack of a
proper showcasing algorithm, artists somehow get lost in the crowd.
Artseum solves such problems. It is an application where artists can browse, share and sell artwork. Since the users are
artists themselves, the feedback is honest. It also allows the users to create a moodboard of artworks they like for
inspiration, thus, solving another one of art related problems called "Art Block".
Furthermore, the users can directly connect to the art community to stay up to date with upcoming trends and styles and
with the help of a dedicated news panel, the users will get updates regarding upcoming art events, or helpful art tips by
renowned artists. In addition to the above features, Artseum also allows the users to build a creative resume comprising of
their best artworks, making it easy for the companies to hire them.
